Simulator for BitFusion

See bitfusion-generate-graphs.ipynb for details on how to use the simulator.


Instead of the ipynb file, use the top.py file.

Actually use the cmd file that invokes top.py with different args.

Also, this needs a python2 conda environment to run.

Many dependencies are needed like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, jupyter, etc.

The dnnweaver2 dependency is resolved by copying that repo inside this repo.
